# Starter Code for Lab 7
Much of this comes from starter code in the e155 repository. I was provided with functions to shift in data using SPI on the FPGA, testbenches for the top module with and wihout SPI shifting, and all of the MCU code. I was also provided with mixColumns since its complexity exceeded that expected for this course.

The rest of the FPGA code was written by me to complete the lab.
